## 📝 Overview

This module covers the fundamentals of using iterations and loops in Python. You'll learn how to automate repetitive tasks, iterate through sequences, and control loop execution with `break`, `continue`, and `else`.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Loops 🎢
- **Why Use Loops?**: Learn about the concept of looping and why it's a cornerstone in programming.
- **Types of Loops in Python**: Understand how to use the `for` and `while` loops to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.

### 2. The `for` Loop 🔁
- **The `range()` Function**: Explore how to use `range()` with `for` loops for numerical iterations.
- **Iterating Over Sequences**: Understand how to use the `for` loop to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.
- **_**: Using the `_` variable to ignore values during iteration.

### 3. The `while` Loop ↩️
- **Basic Usage**: Dive into the `while` loop for repeated execution as long as a condition is true.
- **Conditional Looping**: Using the `while` loop to repeat code as long as a condition remains true.

### 4. `break` and `continue` Statements 🚦
- **The `break` Statement**: Learn how to alter the flow of loops using `break` to exit a loop.
- **The `continue` Statement**: Learn how to alter the flow of loops using `continue` to skip to the next iteration.
- **The `else` Clause in Loops**: Executing code after loop completion, only if not exited by a `break`.

### 5. Looping Techniques 🛠️
- **Basic Syntax**: Learning the basic syntax of `for` and `while` loops.
- **Loop Control Flow**: Understanding how loops execute and control the flow of a program.
- **Optimizing Loop Performance**: Best practices for writing efficient loops.

### 6. Nested Loops 🍱
- **Using Loops Within Loops**: Handling more complex iteration patterns with nested loops.
- **Avoiding Infinite Loops**: Tips for preventing loops that never end.
See how loops can be nested within each other and how to manage complex looping scenarios.
