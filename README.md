# 📘 Iterations and Loops in Python

Welcome to the third module of our Python course at St. Ignatius College, focusing on Iterations and Loops. This module explores the power of repetition in programming, allowing you to execute a block of code multiple times.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- [Theory](./theory): Contains theoretical materials and explanations about different types of loops in Python, including `for` loops and `while` loops.
- [Examples](./examples): Find example problems with solutions here, demonstrating practical uses of loops in various scenarios.
- [Exercises](./exercises): Practice exercises to strengthen your understanding and skills in using loops.
- [Solutions](./solutions): Solutions to the exercises. Try solving the exercises on your own before peeking!

## 📝 Overview

This module covers the fundamentals of using iterations and loops in Python. You'll learn how to automate repetitive tasks, iterate through sequences, and control loop execution with `break`, `continue`, and `else`.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Loops 🎢

Learn about the concept of looping and why it's a cornerstone in programming.

### 2. The `for` Loop 🔁

Understand how to use the `for` loop to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.

### 3. The `while` Loop ↩️

Dive into the `while` loop for repeated execution as long as a condition is true.

### 4. `break` and `continue` Statements 🚦

Learn how to alter the flow of loops using `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.

### 5. Looping Techniques 🛠️

Explore Python's built-in functions and techniques for efficient looping, including `range()`, `enumerate()`, and list comprehensions.

### 6. Nested Loops 🍱

See how loops can be nested within each other and how to manage complex looping scenarios.

## Learning Path 🛣️

Follow through the topics in order to build a solid foundation in managing loops and iterations in Python. Each concept is accompanied by examples and exercises for practical understanding.

# Exercises and Examples 🏋️‍♂️

Each section is accompanied by practical exercises and examples, enabling you to apply the concepts you've learned. Remember, practice is key to mastering programming!
