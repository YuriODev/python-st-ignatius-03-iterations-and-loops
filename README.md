## 📝 Overview

This module covers the fundamentals of using iterations and loops in Python. You'll learn how to automate repetitive tasks, iterate through sequences, and control loop execution with `break`, `continue`, and `else`.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Loops 🎢

Learn about the concept of looping and why it's a cornerstone in programming.

### 2. The `for` Loop 🔁

Understand how to use the `for` loop to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings.

### 3. The `while` Loop ↩️

Dive into the `while` loop for repeated execution as long as a condition is true.

### 4. `break` and `continue` Statements 🚦

Learn how to alter the flow of loops using `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.

### 5. Looping Techniques 🛠️

Explore Python's built-in functions and techniques for efficient looping, including `range()`, `enumerate()`, and list comprehensions.

### 6. Nested Loops 🍱

See how loops can be nested within each other and how to manage complex looping scenarios.

## Learning Path 🛣️

Follow through the topics in order to build a solid foundation in managing loops and iterations in Python. Each concept is accompanied by examples and exercises for practical understanding.

# Exercises and Examples 🏋️‍♂️

Each section is accompanied by practical exercises and examples, enabling you to apply the concepts you've learned. Remember, practice is key to mastering programming!
