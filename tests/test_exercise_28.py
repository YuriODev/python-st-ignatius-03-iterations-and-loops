# # ## Exercise 28: Product of Two Numbers - Medium ðŸ”¥ (Est. Time: 10-15 mins | Points: 20)

# # **Problem:** Given integers a and b. Find their product without using the multiplication operation.

# # ### Input:

# # - Two integers `a` and `b`.

# # ### Output:

# # - An integer representing the product of `a` and `b`.

# # ### Examples:

# # | No. | Inputs | Outputs |
# # | --- | ------ | ------- |
# # | 1   | 7<br> 8 | 56 |
# # | 2 | 5<br> 6 | 30 |
# # | 3 | 3<br> 4 | 12 |
# # | 4 | 10<br> 10 | 100 |

# # ### Note:

# # The problem tests the ability to use loops and conditional statements to calculate the product of two numbers.

# # Your solution to Exercise 28

# # Prompt the user to enter two integers, `a` and `b`.
# a = int(input())
# b = int(input())

# # Initialize the product
# product = 0

# # Calculate the product of a and b
# # If both a and b are negative
# if a < 0 and b < 0:
#     # Convert them to positive and
#     a = abs(a)
#     b = abs(b)
#     # Add b to the product a times.
#     for i in range(a):
#         product += b

# # If a is negative
# elif a < 0:
#     # Convert a to positive
#     a = abs(a)
#     # Add a to the product b times.
#     for i in range(a):
#         product += b
#     product = -product

# # If b is negative
# elif b < 0:
#     # Convert b to positive
#     b = abs(b)
#     # Add b to the product a times.
#     for i in range(b):
#         product += a
#     product = -product

# # If both a and b are positive
# else:
#     # Add b to the product a times.
#     for i in range(a):
#         product += b

# # Output the product  
# print(product)
