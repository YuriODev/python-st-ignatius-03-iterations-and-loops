It prints the current value of `i` and the current character `char` to the console. The `f\"{i = } {char = }\"` is a formatted string literal (also known as f-string) introduced in Python 3.8.

This is important because it moves `i` closer to 2, which is the condition for the `while` loop to stop. Without this line, `i` would always be 0, the `while` loop's condition would always be true, and the `while` loop would execute indefinitely, creating an infinite loop.\n",
